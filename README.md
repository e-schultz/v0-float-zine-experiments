## 🔍 Overview

FLOAT BBS Zine Explorer reimagines the nostalgic BBS (Bulletin Board System) interface through a contemporary cyberpunk lens. It serves as both an interactive exploration tool and a conceptual framework for examining fragmented gender identity and non-linear knowledge management.

The project creates an immersive digital environment that evokes retro computing aesthetics while remaining accessible on modern devices. It explores concepts of gender fluidity, fragmentation, and emergence through interactive digital interfaces while demonstrating alternative knowledge management paradigms that prioritize emotional resonance, non-hierarchical structures, and emergent connections.

## ✨ Features

### Retro Terminal Aesthetic
- Distinctive magenta/pink on black color scheme
- Terminal-inspired UI elements with blinking cursors and command lines
- Monospace typography and ASCII-inspired visual elements

### Mobile-Friendly Design
- Responsive layout adapting to all screen sizes
- Collapsible sidebar navigation for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements

### Core FLOAT System Components
- **Concept Explorer**: Interactive tool for exploring and connecting concepts
- **Advanced Concept Explorer**: Enhanced visualization tool with multiple expansion patterns and interactive graph visualization
- **Ghostline Viewer**: Interface for viewing and interacting with FLOAT traces
- **Projects Registry**: Showcase of applications and tools built with FLOAT
- **DevTools Excavation**: Meta-interface for "observing the unobservable"
- **Identity Fragments**: Exploration of fragmented gender concepts
- **Terminal Interface**: Command-line for interacting with the FLOAT system

## 🧠 Core FLOAT Concepts

The FLOAT system is built around several core principles:

### Shacks not Cathedrals {Ξ}
Choose lightweight, adaptable cognitive structures over rigid complex systems. This principle advocates for minimal viable structures for knowledge capture, embracing imperfection and impermanence.

### Emotional Resonance as Data {ψ}
Truth is validated through affective resonance rather than purely rational means. This approach centers embodied knowledge and recognizes emotional responses as legitimate data points.

### Remembering Forward {∴}
Memory conceptualized as emergence rather than retrieval. This reframes memory as generative rather than extractive, where recursion functions as a form of prophecy.

### Ritual over Routine {■}
Intentional cycles of meaning-making that transform information into knowledge. This emphasizes creating sacred space for knowledge work and establishing boundaries between different modes of thinking.

## 💻 Usage

### Navigation

- Use the main navigation links to explore different sections of the FLOAT system
- On mobile devices, access the navigation menu by clicking the hamburger icon in the top right

### Concept Explorer

The Concept Explorer allows you to browse and search through FLOAT concepts:

1. Use the search bar to filter concepts by name or tags
2. Click on a concept in the left panel to view its details
3. Explore related concepts through the links provided

### Advanced Concept Explorer

The Advanced Concept Explorer provides enhanced visualization capabilities:

1. Select from five different expansion patterns (Concept-Led, Note-Led, Chat-Led, Sigil Seeding, Meta-Path)
2. Enter a seed value appropriate for the selected pattern
3. Explore the generated concept graph through an interactive visualization
4. View detailed information about nodes and connections

For more information, see the [Advanced Concept Explorer documentation](docs/advanced-concept-explorer.md).

### Ghostline Viewer

The Ghostline Viewer allows you to browse and search through traces of past interactions:

1. Use the search bar to filter ghostlines by title or tag
2. View detailed information about each ghostline trace
3. Explore the connections between different traces

### Projects Registry

The Projects Registry showcases applications and tools built with the FLOAT framework:

1. Browse through different projects
2. View project details, status, and tags
3. Access links to contribute to projects or learn more

### DevTools

The DevTools provide access to the underlying systems of the FLOAT framework:

1. Use the Excavation panel to observe the unobservable
2. Access the Console for direct interaction with the runtime
3. Use the Sigil Debugger to monitor and debug active sigils

### Identity Fragments

The Identity Fragments section explores different aspects of fragmented gender identity:

1. Browse through different identity concepts
2. Explore the relationships between identity fragments
3. Understand the hauntological approach to gender and identity

### Terminal Interface

The Terminal Interface allows direct interaction with the FLOAT system:

1. Type commands in the input field and press "Execute" or hit Enter
2. Available commands include:
   - `--help` - Display available commands
   - `--intent "your intention"` - Register an intention
   - `--banish --compost "what you want to release"` - Initiate a banishing ritual
   - `--echo` - Echo back your input
   - `--invoke` - Invoke a specific FLOAT concept
