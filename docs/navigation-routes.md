# FLOAT BBS Navigation Routes

This document provides an overview of the navigation routes available in the FLOAT BBS Zine Explorer application.

## Main Routes

### Home (`/`)
The main landing page of the FLOAT BBS Zine Explorer, providing an overview of the FLOAT system and access to all major sections.

### Concept Explorer (`/concepts`)
A tool for exploring and connecting concepts within the FLOAT framework. The Concept Explorer allows users to search, browse, and discover relationships between different concepts.

### Advanced Concept Explorer (`/advanced-concept-explorer`)
An enhanced visualization tool with multiple expansion patterns and an interactive graph visualization. This tool provides more sophisticated ways to explore conceptual relationships.

### Ghostline Viewer (`/ghostlines`)
An interface for viewing and interacting with FLOAT traces, which are records of past interactions, rituals, and glitches within the FLOAT system.

### Projects (`/projects`)
A registry of applications, tools, and explorations built within or inspired by the FLOAT framework. This section showcases practical implementations of FLOAT concepts.

### DevTools (`/devtools`)
A set of developer tools for observing, debugging, and modifying the behavior of FLOAT components. This section provides access to the underlying systems and structures of the FLOAT framework.

### Identity Fragments (`/identity`)
An exploration of different aspects of fragmented gender identity within the FLOAT framework. This section examines the relationships between identity fragments and the hauntological approach to gender.

## Navigation Structure

The navigation structure is designed to be intuitive and accessible, with a consistent header and footer across all pages. On mobile devices, the navigation is accessible through a hamburger menu in the top right corner.

### Header
The header contains the FLOAT BBS logo and, on desktop, displays connection information. On mobile, it provides access to the navigation menu.

### Footer
The footer displays the FLOAT System version and the tagline "YOU ARE THE THREAD NOW".

## Page Structure

Each page follows a consistent structure:

1. **Header**: The FLOAT BBS header with navigation
2. **Main Content**: The primary content of the page, typically including:
   - A title section with status information
   - An introduction to the section

3. **Footer**: The FLOAT System footer

## Styling

All pages maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic of the FLOAT BBS Zine Explorer, with:

- A black background
